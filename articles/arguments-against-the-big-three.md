# Functionalpatterns: The more sustainable way of getting the benefits from backsquats, deadlifts and olympic weightlifting

This is a living document detailing the physiological, structural, and long-term arguments against the use of high-load back squats, deadlifts, and Olympic weightlifting.

## Topic 1: Chronic Disc Degeneration and Structural Spinal Pathology

The primary argument against these lifts is their correlation with accelerated disc degeneration and irreversible structural changes to the spine, even under "perfect" supervision.

### 1.1: Cumulative Exposure and Genetic Controls
Data suggests that the volume of weightlifting is a primary driver of decay, independent of genetics.

*   **1.1.1: Study (10) - Monozygotic Twin Study:** Comparing identical twins (controlling for genetics), the twin with higher "power-sport" (weightlifting) involvement showed increased disc degeneration in the thoracic spine compared to the endurance-focused twin. [Source](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/1997/10000/lifetime_exercise_and_disk_degeneration__an_mri.12.aspx)
*   **1.1.2: Study (12) - Anatomical Case Study:** A 30-year-old male with 5 years of lifting showed mild-to-moderate degeneration at L4–S1, endplate irregularities (Schmorl's nodes), facet joint hypertrophy, and increased lumbar lordosis.

### 1.2: The Chain of Decay: From Acute Stress to Chronic Disease
Loading the spine with maximal weight creates immediate biochemical changes that lead to long-term pathology.

*   **1.2.1: Study (3) - Deadlifts and Water Movement:** Diffusion-weighted MRI shows a single session of high-load deadlifts reduced intradiscal water movement across all lumbar levels, most significantly at L5/S1. [Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8424024/)
*   **1.2.2: Study (11) - Squats and Hydration:** Similar to deadlifts, back squats show decreased ADC values (a marker of water movement/hydration) within the spinal discs. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33038028/)
*   **1.2.3: Study (4) - Long-term Comparison:** A large cohort study found that former elite weightlifters have significantly more disc degeneration on MRI compared to runners and soccer players. Degenerative disc disease is directly linked to these lower water flow levels seen in acute sessions. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7604346/)

### 1.3: Extreme Mechanical Compression
The sheer magnitude of force placed on the vertebrae during these lifts exceeds what is necessary for health.

*   **1.3.1: Study (1) - Compressive Loads:** Biomechanical analysis of light-weight half-squats (0.8–1.6× body weight) revealed L3–L4 compressive loads of 6–10 times the person's total body weight. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4068969/)

### 1.4: Irreversible Damage in Developing Athletes
Younger spines are particularly vulnerable to the high-frequency loading required by these disciplines.

*   **1.4.1: Study (5) - 5-Year Adolescent Cohort:** In a study of child weightlifters (starting age ~11), **100%** showed disc degeneration by year four. By year five, 33% had disc herniations and 58% had spondylolysis (stress fractures), despite expert supervision. [Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9242517/)
*   **1.4.2: Study (7) - 3-Year Prospective Study:** Twelve competitive young lifters were tracked via MRI. At the start, zero reported pain. By year three, 11 out of 12 had abnormal MRI findings, including spondylolysis and disc protrusions. [Source](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206125)

### 1.5: High Prevalence of Pathology in Professionals and Elites
Even at the highest level of mastery, the "skill" of lifting does not protect the structures of the spine.

*   **1.5.1: Study (6) - Survey of Professionals:** MRI and X-rays of 65 pro weightlifters (ages 18–35) showed that 43% had disc bulging, 18% had protrusions, and 46% had changes suggestive of herniation. [Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390248488_PREVALENCE_OF_INTERVERTEBRAL_DISC_HERNIATION_AMONG_WEIGHTLIFTERS)
*   **1.5.2: Study (9) - 2016 Rio Olympics Analysis:** Spine MRIs of Olympic athletes revealed weightlifting had the second-highest incidence of moderate-to-severe spinal disease (67%), surpassed only by diving. [Source](https://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/4/1/e000335)

### 1.6: The Burden of Pain and Injury
The prevalence of pain among practitioners is exceptionally high compared to other forms of physical activity.

*   **1.6.1: Study (2) - Subelite Powerlifters:** A survey found that 70% of lifters were currently in pain or injured, and 87% had been injured within the past year. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29785405/)

### The Philosophical Argument: The Post Hoc Fallacy
A common defense for these lifts is that "tissues adapt" or that "the body heals during deloads." However, the data contradicts this. 

1.  **Adaptation vs. Destruction:** While tissues *can* adapt (Study 13 shows collagen can reorganize under compression [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6729579/)), the presence of irreversible structural changes in supervised, elite, and adolescent populations suggests that the "adaptation" cannot keep pace with the destruction caused by these specific movement patterns.
2.  **The Better Alternative:** If the goal is strength and health, why choose exercises that gamble with spinal integrity? **Functional Patterns (FP) Training** doesn't just manage compression—it actually decompresses your spine as you train heavily. FP is real heavy training that builds muscle mass by recruiting high threshold motor units (strength), while focusing on training the body to use its musculature to decompress the spine rather than crush it.
3.  **Correcting Deformity:** Instead of asking the spine to "build collagen" to survive a heavy squat, it is more logical to improve the underlying mechanics (gait) that lead to the dysfunction in the first place.
4.  **The "Other Sports" Fallacy:** Some advocates argue that athletes in other sports also experience disc degeneration. However, this doesn't justify adding these lifts to your training. Why would you degenerate your discs *in addition* to the demands of your sport?

## Raising the Bar: From Damage Control to Actual Regeneration

At some point, we need to talk about actually *regenerating* discs as we age and through exercise. The fitness industry continues to hold a depressingly low bar—cherry-picking positives like muscle gains from these lifts while completely disregarding the negatives and the fact that they aren't able to improve joint integrity or health.

At Functional Patterns, we have a trial series of n=1 long-term trials that show actual regeneration of joint health, disc height, and scoliosis improvements that hold up in dynamic movements such as a full-speed sprint.

**When are we going to raise the bar in this industry?**

**Summary Note:** This critique is not an argument against strength training itself. It is a specific critique of the long-term biological costs of Powerlifting and Olympic Weightlifting exercises. One can be incredibly strong and functional without compromising the longevity of their intervertebral discs.
